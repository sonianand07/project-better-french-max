# 🔄 **FRESH DATA WORKFLOW WITH AUTO-CLEANUP**

## ✅ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

Your French News system now has a **"process and consume"** workflow exactly as requested! Here's what we've built:

---

## 🎯 **NEW WORKFLOW OVERVIEW**

### **🔄 Process Flow:**
1. **Collect** → Scrape fresh French news (last 24 hours only)
2. **Filter** → Remove articles older than 24 hours
3. **Process** → Score, curate, and deduplicate articles
4. **Store** → Save curated + rejected articles permanently
5. **Clean** → **Automatically delete raw data** (no reprocessing!)

### **📁 Data Storage Strategy:**
- **Raw Data**: ⏱️ **Temporary** - deleted after processing
- **Curated Data**: 💾 **Permanent** - high-quality articles for your app
- **Rejected Data**: 📋 **Permanent** - rejected articles for analysis
- **Archive**: 🗄️ **Historical** - old data moved here

---

## 🚀 **HOW TO USE THE NEW SYSTEM**

### **⭐ RECOMMENDED: Auto-Cleanup Pipeline**
```bash
# From project root
./02_Scripts/setup_env.sh
# Choose option 4: "Run AUTO-CLEANUP pipeline"
```

### **🔄 What Happens:**
1. ✅ Scrapes fresh news from 25+ French sources
2. ✅ Filters to **last 24 hours only** (no old articles)
3. ✅ Processes through quality curator (scores 0-30)
4. ✅ Saves curated articles permanently
5. ✅ **Deletes raw data automatically** (no accumulation!)
6. ✅ Ready for hourly/daily automated runs

---

## 📊 **TYPICAL RESULTS (Fresh 24h Run)**

### **Expected Volume:**
- **Raw articles collected**: ~200-400 (24 hours)
- **Curated articles**: ~170-340 (85% retention)
- **Rejected articles**: ~30-60 (duplicates/low quality)
- **Raw data cleanup**: ✅ **Automatic deletion**

### **Quality Metrics:**
- **Average score**: 17-18/30 (excellent threshold)
- **Quality focus**: Content for expats/immigrants in France
- **No duplicates**: Smart deduplication applied
- **Fresh content**: Maximum 24 hours old
